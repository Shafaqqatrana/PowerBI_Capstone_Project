I am excited to share my latest data visualization project using Power BI.

As We know in Real Life Scenario a client let's you know their requirements, like what they want in Power BI report, So Analytics Vidhya also gave some questions which were.

4.What is the overall discount%?

5.What are the to 5 selling categories?
